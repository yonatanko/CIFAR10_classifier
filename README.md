This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR10 database. A key goal is to achieve over 80% accuracy with less than 50,000 trainable parameters. Notably, the project incorporates various data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance and generalization. The repository provides detailed documentation on the training process, model architectures, hyperparameters, and the impact of different data augmentation methods, showcasing a comprehensive approach to CNN-based image classification.
